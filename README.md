I Am Tejas I just added this message to the README.md. Now I am going to save the file using VS Code, but the work is not done with git! Now I've edited this file on the `first-branch`-branch.

Saving the file simply writes the new text to your hard disk. We need to tell git that we want to preserve these changes for the project (making a
"commit"), then send them
back to the repository on GitHub so the rest of our team can see them (this is "pushing to origin").

Make changes with the Web IDE!

Another remote commit was made that i want to fetch to my local repository and pull if there are no conflicts. And now I've edited this file on the `main`-branch.**I add some text to the same line but now on `main`, will this give me a conflict?**
**I've added some text to this line now from the branch `conflicting-instructions'**
